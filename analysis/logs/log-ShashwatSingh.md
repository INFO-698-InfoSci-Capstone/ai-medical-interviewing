### Date: 
Week number, today's date, etc. 


### Number of hours: 
A quantity of hours, maybe towards specific tasks. 

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous weekly/bi-weekly working period, such as something you found particularly rewarding. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future. 

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. 

## Additional thought
Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.

## Week 9 – March 11–17, 2025

### Shashwat Singh

**Number of hours:** 8

**Rose:**  
Successfully redesigned the prompt structure to better guide AI responses. It was exciting to see more coherent and medically appropriate outputs.

**Bud:**  
Looking forward to integrating the redesigned prompts into the MCC interface and testing them live.

**Thorn:**  
Understanding how the regeneration logic interacted with prompt chaining was initially confusing without full context.

**Additional Thought:**  
This was my first deep dive into prompt engineering for real-world use cases—great learning curve.

## Week 10 – March 18–24, 2025

### Shashwat Singh

**Number of hours:** 9

**Rose:**  
Worked on improving the UI/UX for better data presentation and user flow. Feels much cleaner and user-friendly now.

**Bud:**  
Looking forward to backend integration with OpenAI API and testing multi-turn interactions.

**Thorn:**  
Design tweaks kept needing alignment with changing prompt structure, which slowed things down.

**Additional Thought:**  
Maybe we should document the prompt logic flow in diagrams for easier cross-team understanding.

## Week 11 – March 25–31, 2025

### Shashwat Singh

**Number of hours:** 10

**Rose:**  
Implemented backend lock/unlock functionality for editable table fields—a crucial component for user control.

**Bud:**  
Excited to test AI-driven responses for locked/unlocked fields.

**Thorn:**  
Needed to sync frequently with Jasdeep to ensure context logic matched backend field states.

## Week 12 – April 1–7, 2025

### Shashwat Singh

**Number of hours:** 11

**Rose:**  
Tested AI content locking features and table-level AI responses—most scenarios worked smoothly.

**Bud:**  
Looking forward to the virtual patient interface launch and AI fine-tuning.

**Thorn:**  
Some locked cells still allowed AI overwrite—needs one more round of validation.

**Additional Thought:**  
Would be helpful to assign clear QA test cases next time to streamline validation.

## Week 13 – April 8–14, 2025

### Shashwat Singh

**Number of hours:** 10

**Rose:**  
Successfully integrated table-level AI generation with prompt chaining logic. It was rewarding to see smooth, consistent outputs across rows during test runs.

**Bud:**  
Looking forward to fine-tuning AI outputs and finalizing the poster layout for iShowcase.

**Thorn:**  
Faced some issues with token limits and cutoff responses while handling multi-row AI generation. Still needs handling for overflow cases.

**Additional Thought:**  
Consider breaking long prompts into chunks and caching sub-responses where appropriate.

## Week 14 – April 15–21, 2025

### Shashwat Singh

**Number of hours:** 11

**Rose:**  
Finalized feature testing for table-level AI and completed polishing of editable field validations. Also worked on final poster content and layout structure.

**Bud:**  
Excited to present at iShowcase and gather real user feedback during the demo.

**Thorn:**  
Synchronizing poster design edits between multiple team members delayed final layout progress slightly.

**Additional Thought:**  
Might be helpful to assign poster sections next time to avoid overlapping edits and streamline formatting.

## Week 15 – April 22–28, 2025

### Shashwat Singh

**Number of hours:** 10

**Rose:**  
Finalized poster and presentation materials for iShowcase. Also completed and merged the lock functionality to the main branch after approval — a key feature milestone.

**Bud:**  
Looking forward to presenting at iShowcase on May 7th and sharing the project’s impact with peers and faculty.

**Thorn:**  
Balancing final project adjustments and poster preparation has been slightly challenging with tight deadlines.

**Additional Thought:**  
Preparing the presentation has helped in refining key messaging and focusing on the most impactful aspects of the project.
