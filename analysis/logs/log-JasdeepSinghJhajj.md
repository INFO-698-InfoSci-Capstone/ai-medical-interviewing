# Weekly/Bi-Weekly Log

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Date: 
Week number, today's date, etc. 


### Number of hours: 
A quantity of hours, maybe towards specific tasks. 

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous weekly/bi-weekly working period, such as something you found particularly rewarding. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future. 

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. 

## Additional thought
Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.

## Week 9 – March 11–17, 2025

### Jasdeep Singh Jhajj

**Number of hours:** 9

**Rose:**  
Implemented multi-column data context retention, allowing AI to recognize and maintain context across different table fields.

**Bud:**  
Looking forward to refining logic accumulation to ensure AI responses remain coherent over longer interactions.

**Thorn:**  
Debugging multi-column context was trickier than expected—needed extra alignment with Shashwat to sync UI interactions.

**Additional Thought:**  
Might be helpful to set up automated test cases for context validation across different datasets.

## Week 10 – March 18–24, 2025

### Jasdeep Singh Jhajj

**Number of hours:** 10

**Rose:**  
Made strong progress on the logic context accumulation, focusing on how AI tracks and interprets sequential user inputs.

**Bud:**  
Looking forward to initiating field-level AI integration, especially how user-edited fields will guide AI responses.

**Thorn:**  
Balancing long-term context retention with relevance was tricky—AI occasionally reused outdated information.

**Additional Thought:**  
Adding unit-level logs for context states might help pinpoint where breakdowns happen during chaining.

## Week 11 – March 25–31, 2025

### Jasdeep Singh Jhajj

**Number of hours:** 10

**Rose:**  
Started working on field-level AI integration, allowing the system to tailor responses based on individual field states.

**Bud:**  
Excited to test more complex input combinations and how well the AI adapts across form variations.

**Thorn:**  
Some field overrides weren’t correctly syncing with context updates—required a backend logic fix.

**Additional Thought:**  
A modular system for field-type recognition might simplify context-to-response mapping later on.

## Week 12 – April 1–7, 2025

### Jasdeep Singh Jhajj

**Number of hours:** 11

**Rose:**  
Started working on table-level AI integration, allowing AI to generate more structured responses based on table content along with context accumulation logic improvements.

**Bud:**  
Looking forward to finalizing AI-driven adjustments for data structuring within tables.

**Thorn:**  
Ensuring consistency between field-level and table-level AI logic is proving challenging, some mismatches still need fine-tuning.

---

## Week 13 – April 8–14, 2025

### Jasdeep Singh Jhajj

**Number of hours:** 11

**Rose:**  
Successfully implemented form-level context accumulation, enabling the AI to reference and build upon all previously generated data across the entire form for more consistent, context-aware responses.

**Bud:**  
Looking forward to finalizing the poster layout for iShowcase and testing full-form sequential generations.

**Thorn:**  
Encountered challenges managing prompt size and token limits when combining full-form context; required careful trimming of less critical details.

**Additional Thought:**  
Considering breaking larger context blocks into modular prompts to reduce overflow and improve maintainability.

---

## Week 14 – April 15–21, 2025

### Jasdeep Singh Jhajj

**Number of hours:** 10

**Rose:**  
Completed the full integration of form-level context collection into the AI pipeline, ensuring the system now produces consistent outputs that account for previously generated data across multiple tables and sections.

**Bud:**  
Excited to prepare the final poster content and layout for iShowcase and test the combined demo setup.

**Thorn:**  
Faced occasional mismatches between accumulated context and live field updates, requiring refinement of backend logic to sync field states accurately.

**Additional Thought:**  
Adding automated validation checks for context alignment could improve reliability as we scale to more complex input forms.

## Week 15 – April 22–28, 2025

### Jasdeep Singh Jhajj
**Number of hours:** 10

**Rose:**
Finalized poster and presentation materials for iShowcase. Tested the functionality for integration test with other services.

**Bud:**
Looking forward to presenting at iShowcase on May 7th and sharing the project’s impact with peers and faculty.

**Thorn:**
Balancing final project adjustments and poster preparation has been slightly challenging with tight deadlines.

**Additional Thought:**
Preparing the presentation has helped in refining key messaging and focusing on the most impactful aspects of the project.
