## 📘 Project Overview

This project enhances an existing AI-powered medical interviewing platform to improve automated patient interactions and structured response generation. Our focus has been on improving:
- AI Prompt Optimization: Refining prompt structures for more accurate and medically relevant AI responses.
- Context Accumulation: Enabling AI to retain and recall prior interactions for multi-turn conversations.
- Field- & Table-Level AI Integration: Implementing context-aware AI response generation based on structured form inputs.
- User Experience (UI/UX): Enhancing the interface for smoother user interactions and feedback.
- Backend Features: Implementing locking mechanisms to control AI-generated content within editable medical forms.
This work builds on a pre-existing project, and we've adapted our efforts accordingly to focus on feature development and enhancement rather than building from scratch.
