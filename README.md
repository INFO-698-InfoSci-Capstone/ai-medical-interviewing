This repository documents the work completed by **Shashwat Singh** and **Jasdeep Singh Jhajj** for the INFO 698 Capstone, under the **VIP project: AI in Medical Interviewing**, mentored by **Dr. Allan Hamilton** and **Dr. Win Burleson**.

## 📘 Project Overview

This project enhances an existing AI-powered medical interviewing platform. Our focus has been on improving:
- AI prompt design and regeneration
- Context accumulation for coherent multi-turn responses
- UI/UX for a user-friendly interaction layer
- Field- and table-level AI integration
- Backend features like locking and content control

This work builds on a pre-existing project, and we've adapted our efforts accordingly to focus on feature development and enhancement rather than building from scratch.
